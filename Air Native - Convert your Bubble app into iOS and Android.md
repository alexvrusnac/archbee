## ​✏️ Introduction

Embedding your existing Bubble app into mobile applications is a super easy process with our new [Air Native](https://zeroqode.com/native) service.

All you need is to indicate your app URL and add your own images like splash screen, icons, etc., and we'll handle the rest.

What you'll get from us are ready-made builds for Android and iOS apps, ready to be published to Google Play and App Store.

:::hint
**Tip**: With Air Native, you can have your native iOS and Android builds ready even if your Bubble app is not complete yet. You can already order the builds to have the native environment for testing, and simply focus on the development process of your app 🚀​
:::

:::hint
**Note**: App Store & Google Play Publishing is not included by default. If you'd like us to take care of the publishing process, it can be purchased as an add-on to your builds order.​

## ​✔️ Prerequisites

Tip: Check the Bubble tips and tricks for native section of this doc, to optimize the design and performance for Android and iOS.Before converting your Bubble app to native apps, you need to have the following accounts:

| **#** | **Account**           | **Link**                                                                                               | **Price**    |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1     | Apple Developer       | <https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/>[​](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/​)       | $99 per year |
| 2     | Google Play Developer | [<https://developer.android.com/distribute/console>](https://developer.android.com/distribute/console) | $25 one-time |
| 3     | OneSignal             | <https://onesignal.com/>[​](https://onesignal.com/​)                                                   | Free         |
| 4     | Firebase              | <https://firebase.google.com/>[​](https://firebase.google.com/​)                                       | Free         |

The Apple and Google Developer accounts are necessary for publishing the native apps to App Store and Google Play, under your own name.

The OneSignal and Firebase accounts are needed for Push Notifications configurations, in case your app requires such functionality. You will be able to monitor all the data and manage all configurations under your own accounts.

:::hint
**Note**: There are two types of Apple Developer Program memberships: Individual and Organizational. We recommend choosing the Organizational account because it is much easier to handle the uploading and publishing process. If you have the Individual, it is best to change it to Organizational (based on new Apple Developer policies, the invited team members can create certificates only if you have this type of account).​

## ​🚧 How it works

The whole process is pretty straight-forward. You just order your builds (and publishing if needed), then submit the app details from your Zeroqode Profile -> Air Native tab, and we'll notify you back within 24 hours\* when builds are ready to be published.

:::hint
\***Note**: 24h turnaround time applies only for the Builds and applies to work days only. It starts to count from the moment of adding the additional app details from the zeroqode.com profile -> Air Native tab.
:::

:::hint
**Warning**: After receiving the builds, please do not delete any of the Firebase or OneSignal configurations. Otherwise, the native apps will not function as expected.
:::

### Order builds

The first step is to purchase your native builds.

​1⃣ Go to [zeroqode.com/native](https://zeroqode.com/native), and scroll down to locate the pricing section.&#x20;

:::hint
**Tip**: The Android + iOS Builds price is $299. It is a one-time payment and you are able to convert only one Bubble app. In case you want to have two (and more) Bubble apps converted to native apps, it is required to purchase another license.
:::

:::hint
**Tip**: You can change your App URL to use a different Bubble project under the same license. There are 3 rebuilds you can do for free in the first month after purchasing the license. If using the all 3/3 rebuilds, or the month has passed by, the rebuilds will become paid. A rebuild will cost $49.
:::

:::hint
**Note**: Check the [App Store review guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) and [Google Play review guidelines](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/launch-checklist) prior to submission. In case of any guideline violation, Apple/Google may reject your app. You will have to solve all the mentioned violations before submitting your app again.

## ​🚀 Bubble tips and tricks for native

There are many ways to plan the architecture of your Bubble app. It is really a matter of choice how to design and build the logic.

:::hint
**Tip**: It is optional, but the following points will considerably help you boost the speed and performance of your Android and iOS, as well as prevent potential rejection from Apple/Google.
:::

1\. Your Bubble app should be a [Single Page Application](https://medium.com/@NeotericEU/single-page-application-vs-multiple-page-application-2591588efe58). Try to use just one page for your entire app (if possible), and use the show/hide actions.

2\. The "page redirects" should happen through [custom states](https://bubble.io/video-course/how-to-use-custom-states-1611172317504x526496571283210240) and/or option sets.Note: Using URL parameters will considerably slow down your native apps. Please try to avoid it.

3\. Hide all the unnecessary elements on your page, even if they are not seen!

4\. Think over loading from the database in advance. Filter the unnecessary.

5\. Design your Bubble app with native principles in your mind. It will help a lot at the publishing stage (especially for App Store, because the guys from Apple Review Team are quite picky and may reject your app).Some great mobile UX design resources:

:::hint
**Note**: To prevent app rejection from Apple/Google, please check the [App Store review guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) and [Google Play review guidelines](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/launch-checklist) prior to submission. In case of any guideline violation, Apple/Google may reject your app. You will have to solve all the mentioned violations before submitting your app again.6. Optimise your app. Remove any unnecessary plugins, styles, JavaScript code, etc.​
